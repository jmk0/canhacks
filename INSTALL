Multiple tools are maintained in this repository.  Brief instructions
here on how to use:

sf_can_crap.ino

Arduino sketch.  Copy to your sketch folder and upload it to your
Arduino.

Requires
  1) the Arduino (tested on UNO)
  2) a Sparkfun CAN-BUS Shield (DEV-13262)
  3) a micro SD card inserted into the slot
  4) the CAN BUS Arduino library: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_CAN-Bus_Arduino_Library

On initialization, the OPEN LED (D7 on the shield) will slowly blink
on error (e.g. no SD card).  While recording data to the SD card, that
same LED will flicker.

Data is recorded to the SD card using the filename "candata.bin".  The
contents are fixed-size binary records of the tCAN structure format.
See canhexdump.cpp for more.



canhexdump
g++ -o canhexdump canhexdump.cpp
canhexdump <input file>
e.g.
canhexdump candata.bin

Columns are:
  1) message ID in hex.
  2) "rtr" field of message header from MCP2515 (either 0 or -1).
     No, I don't know what this is exactly yet.
  3) Number of bytes in the CAN message.
  4+ The bytes of the CAN message, in hex
